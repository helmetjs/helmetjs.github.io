Helmet only deals with HTTP headers, but there are a number of other helpful security modules for Express. We haven't heavily audited these—that's what the [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/) is for—but take a look at some of these modules!

* [express-enforces-ssl](https://github.com/aredo/express-enforces-ssl)
* [express-content-length-validator](https://github.com/ericmdantas/express-content-length-validator)
* [hpp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hpp)
* [cors](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cors)

This module also exists in other environments. Some are direct ports where others are similar modules.

* Crystal: [crystal-helmet](https://github.com/EvanHahn/crystal-helmet)
* Flask (Python framework): [Talisman](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/flask-talisman)
* Go: [secure](https://github.com/unrolled/secure)
* Koa (Node framework): [koa-helmet](https://github.com/venables/koa-helmet)
